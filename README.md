# CS-596 Assignment 3: Tic-Tac-Toe
This my version of a multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game.

### Gameplay
This is how the gameplay works in my version of Tic-Tac-Toe:
<ul>
    <li>One player selects to be the host and the other player selects to be the client by pushing the respective buttons</li>
    <li>The host is X's and the client is O's</li>
    <li>When the game is first launched the host goes first then the client.</li>
    <li>A timer starts with 30 seconds and counts down the person whose turn it is has 30 seconds to make a move</li>
    <li>After 30 seconds the player's turn is up and the turn changes to the other player</li>
    <li>After a win or a tie game the game over panel will appear showing who won, who lost or tie and give you option to play again<li>
    <li>When the play again button is clicked:
        <ul>
            <li>If the host won the game the client starts first in the next game</li>
            <li>If the client won the game then the host starts first in the next game</li>
            <li>If the host made the final move that tied the game the client goes first in the next game</li>
            <li>If the client made the final move that tied the game the host goes first in the next game</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

### <u>Sounds</u>
The following sounds are triggred in the game when:
<ol>
    <li>"Start Host" button is clicked</li>
    <li>"Start Client" button is clicked</li>
    <li>A host or client makes a move on their turn</li>
    <li>A host or client makes a move when it isn't their turn</li>
    <li>the timer first starts up to twenty seconds</li>
